## page_cache_async_readahead

page_cache_async_readahead()源码也在mm/readahead.c文件中,异步提前读取
多个页面到内存中

```
/**
 * page_cache_async_readahead - file readahead for marked pages
 * @mapping: address_space which holds the pagecache and I/O vectors
 * @ra: file_ra_state which holds the readahead state
 * @filp: passed on to ->readpage() and ->readpages()
 * @page: the page at @offset which has the PG_readahead flag set
 * @offset: start offset into @mapping, in pagecache page-sized units
 * @req_size: hint: total size of the read which the caller is performing in
 *            pagecache pages
 *
 * page_cache_async_readahead() should be called when a page is used which
 * has the PG_readahead flag; this is a marker to suggest that the application
 * has used up enough of the readahead window that we should start pulling in
 * more pages.
